# Automate Windows Deployment
This app helps you customise and automate the whole Windows setup plus the software ecosystem with your own personal settings, drivers, apps and work environments. It also helps you debloat Windows, optimize, improve privacy and security.
Typicat use case scenarios:
- you are reinstalling a system on the same or different machine for any number of reasons (crash, upgrade, machine replacement etc)
- you are installing a specific system/configuration on a number of different machines
This is geared towards developers who typically need to install a lot of tools/apps, each with their own configurations, security settings, logins on top of the typical Windows apps, but it will work just as well for any type of professional who needs to install any number of apps/systems/settings.

# Status
This app's development is paused, moved to an Electron version as the main development effort. Should that fail, I will continue here.
